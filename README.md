# My Portfolio!

A place for me to put some details about myself and a side project for me to work on to keep my web dev skills sharp.


## To run locally

1. in `client/src/utils/backendApi.js` uncomment the localhost line for the baseUrl
2. open 2 terminals
3. in one terminal cd into backend and run `npm run start`
4. in other terminal cd into client and run `npm run start`

Note: for Mac OSX Monterey disable Airplay Receiver in System Preference > Sharing, as it runs on port 5000 and blocks the backend node app
