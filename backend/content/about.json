    "heading": "Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Abby!",
    "description": "I joined IBM in 2019 as a full stack web developer before moving to IBM Quantum as a Developer Advocate in March 2021. I now lead an interdisciplinary team of developer advocates, software developers and quantum researchers, focused on maintaining and promoting IBM Quantum Software, particularly Qiskit, IBMâ€™s Open Source SDK for Quantum Computers computing. My day to day varies a lot, from pushing code to one of the Qiskit repositories, to reviewing PRs, to giving talks and workshops, to filming YouTube videos, to writing blogs and documentation.  As a primarily self taught software developer who hasnâ€™t studied physics since high school I never thought I would end up in the field that sheâ€™s in, and Iâ€™m passionate about encouraging people from any background to pursue their interest in technology. Please don't hesitate to reach out with speaking or writing enquiries ðŸ˜Š"
